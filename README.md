# A-Study-of-Force-and-Moment-Characteristics-in-BLDC-motor-with-Variable-RPMs.
Project Report
Designed and implemented the experimental setup for measuring thrust and anti-torque moment of a BLDC motor–propeller system at
variable RPMs using Arduino UNO, HX711 load cells, and a tachometer
• Performed calibration procedures to ensure accurate acquisition of load and moment data, improving experimental reliability
• Processed and analyzed data in MATLAB, generating Gaussian distributions, histograms, and RPM vs Load/Moment plots to evaluate motor
performance
• Identified the positive correlation between RPM and thrust/moment, and discussed implications for efficiency and torque performance
• Proposed improvements such as optimizing mounting design, increasing dataset size, and extending numerical analysis for predictive accuracy
